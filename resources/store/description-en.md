You own a Raspberry Pi? You're using pilight (http://pilight.org) for the control of your devices? Then illumina is the Android App for you!

illumina allows to you fully control your radio outlets, the brightness of your dimmable lights and opens and closes the screens of your windows. If there is a temperature or humidity sensor connected to your Pi or you've got a compatible weather-station, illumina will visualize those values. Furthermore the order of devices and the possible read-only state will be respected.

Highlights:
• multiple designs
• automatic connection with SSDP
• distinguishes between places
• switch radio outlets
• control compatible dimmers
• open and close screens
• visualize contact sensors
• visualize temperature and humidity
• respects device ordering
• reacts to changes made by other sources

If you have questions regarding pilight or the list of compatible devices, consult the wiki behind http://wiki.pilight.org

Important!
illumina only works in conjunction with a pilight-daemon and a version greater or equal 2.0 running within your network.
